## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional grievance systems suffer from **"black hole" reporting** — citizens file complaints and never hear back, while top officials have no real oversight into which departments are actually resolving issues versus quietly closing tickets without action.

This isn't a tooling gap. It's an **accountability gap**, and most systems are built in a way that lets it persist.

## 💡 The Solution

CM360 closes the loop structurally, not procedurally — the system makes false closures and silent stalling difficult, rather than just discouraging them as policy.

| Mechanism | What It Does |
|---|---|
| 🧭 **Automated Magic Routing** | Every grievance is auto-assigned to the exact officer responsible for that district + department — no manual sorting, no bounced tickets. |
| 📷 **Anti-Corruption Verification** | Officers cannot mark a ticket "Resolved" by clicking a button. They are structurally required to upload photographic evidence of the fix. |
| ✅ **Citizen Trust Loop** | A ticket is only permanently closed once the citizen verifies the resolution. Rejected fixes reopen automatically and impact the department's accountability score. |
| 📊 **Live Department Scoreboard** | Every department (PWD, DJB, BSES) is ranked on real, verified closures — not self-reported numbers. |

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **CM Command Center** — A high-level analytics dashboard with live sync, critical alert monitoring, and a real-time Citizen Trust Index.
- **District Hotspot Mapping** — Live visual distribution of grievances across jurisdictions, built with Recharts.
- **Department Accountability Scoreboard** — Algorithmic performance scoring based on verified closures, not self-reported status.
- **Secure Evidence Vault** — Cloudinary-backed, immutable photo storage for both citizen-filed and officer-resolved evidence.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Strict JWT-driven middleware enforcing data isolation between Citizens, Officers, and Admins.
